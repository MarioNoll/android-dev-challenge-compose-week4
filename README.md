## :scroll: Description
Weather app for Android Dev Challenge Week #4.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
In the "Android Dev Challenge Finale" I took some time to dive into the animation APIs
and truly had some fun. Using the material theme and being able to provide a dark mode
version with ease was fun as well :)
